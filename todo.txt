# choosing between just singing, dance, and both
***** I want the user to be able to choose between singing, dancing, or both. I envision the exact same screen as the "Easy, Medium, and Hard," except this one allows the user to "CHOOSE BETWEEN" "JUST SING," "JUST DANCE" and a different colored extra interesting "BOTH" button. This selection would go before the difficult choosing screen.
