Where to Access the Selected Mode:
You can access the game mode in the PoseComparison component (PoseComparison.tsx:59):
// The gameMode prop is available throughout the component
// Possible values: 'sing' | 'dance' | 'both' | null

export default function PoseComparison({
  referenceVideoUrl,
  onChangeVideo,
  gameMode,  // ‚Üê Access it here!
}: PoseComparisonProps)
Example usage in PoseComparison.tsx:
// Check which mode is selected
if (gameMode === 'sing') {
  // Enable microphone/audio analysis only
}
if (gameMode === 'dance') {
  // Enable pose detection only (current behavior)
}
if (gameMode === 'both') {
  // Enable both microphone and pose detection
}
The mode is currently logged to console (PoseComparison.tsx:62) so you can see it working immediately!
